        <p style="padding: 30px;">Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business
          magnate, inventor, and
          investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar;
          a member of The Walt Disney Company&#39;s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the
          founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
          1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.<br />Jobs was born
          in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs
          attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking
          enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's
          Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of
          the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial
          potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led
          to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the
          first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with
          the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</p>
